<h1>LOST IN THE STARS </h1>
<h2> CHAPTER ONE (The Beginning) </h2>
<p> “The final evacuation process has commenced we hope everyone is at the evacuation location if you aren’t you are advised to buzz us here at the evacuation station,” Lucas my older brother announced for the last time before launching the surveyor drone to see if anyone was still remaining. My younger brother Alex nudged me to see he had just completed the final stage of War Bots a very popular game in Generia. “Nice high score but it’s nowhere near mine,” I said smiling. 
</p>
<p> After everyone entered the spacecraft meant for them, we left the station and went to our spacecraft’s. We entered our spacecraft, we were the last ones left my older sister manned the control switches while my older brother took the steering. My younger siblings and me sat behind watching our older siblings behave responsibly, I was kind of proud of my older brother, yesterday was our last night on Generia so we did boys night, we played games and watched an action movie my sisters were bored so they came to join us then we watched a horror movie, my sisters couldn’t sleep so we all slept in our parents room because the bed was quite large. Scientists and engineers were the first to go to the new planet to set things up my parents wanted us to come with them but Lucas and Madilyn wanted to stay back and help the evacuation committee because they were running short of members, and I wanted to take notes of the last day of Generia and my parents agreed that we five should come together. 
</p>
<p> As we flew up passing Generia’s thick clouds, atmosphere and strong gravity I saw the ground split. Finally, we got out and I watched as my planet crumbled the only place I could call home was being destroyed, as I looked I saw it blast in many pieces I felt a hot drop of tear fall on my cheek. “Don’t worry it will be alright soon enough,” my older sister Madilyn said as she hugged me. “We are going to find another inhabitable planet we will dwell in, the scientists said it just 20 light-days,” my older brother added. I simply nodded as we walked to our hypersleep chambers. As I was about to enter my hypersleep chamber I looked to my side and I saw my older brother put my younger brother into his hypersleep chamber, and I thought aloud “I hope mum and dad are alright”. “I’m sure they are fine”; my older sister said helping my younger sister Alice into her hypersleep chamber. “Yeah,” I said as I placed the stethoscope looking thing on my head and my chest, and pressed the start button.
</p>
<p> Beep beep beep beep! ”Huh, what’s going the ship isn’t supposed to do that”, I thought as I woke up. I opened the hypersleep chamber and went to check what was going on, as I went to the motherboard I looked up and I saw a black hole up ahead and it hit me that the medium-sized black hole was the reason for the alert but we were too close to avoid it. Immediately I went to defrost Lucas and Madilyn. “Oh no,” it takes 10 minutes to defrost I was seriously panicking. It was 9 minutes 59 seconds remaining till the spacecraft got sucked into the black hole. I had read about black holes that things that get sucked into it never came out instead they got ripped apart. Damn it why did I ever read the black hole book, I thought aloud. Five minutes into the black hole the spacecraft was beeping like crazy. I searched around for the spacecraft manual, “shit I can’t find it think max think where would Lucas keep a book he doesn’t care about,” I thought aloud. “I’ve gotten it!” I exclaimed. Under his bed, I remembered the last time I gave Lucas my Brainiac the Menace comic book I found it under his bed. When I asked the next day he said it was nerdy and he didn’t want to mean and I sarcastically replied “How nice of you”. Beep beep beep beep!!! the danger alert of the spacecraft jolted me back to reality. Three minutes remaining the spacecraft warned, oh come on don’t tell me I was lost in thoughts for two minutes I thought aloud as I checked under the steering sit for the manual.
 </p>
<p> My hand hit something, “aha there you are”. “Damn I am smart,” I praised myself. I opened to check the table of content, but there wasn’t one. Are you kidding how you write a book without a table of content I thought as I flipped the pages to see if there was anything I could do to survive the mess we were about to get into and then something caught my attention a “force field”. The spacecraft had a force field at least that should keep us alive till Lucas and Madilyn wake up. They should know what to do, one minute remaining to the black hole entry and then a scary thought crept into my mind. “We are all gonna die and I haven’t gotten my first kiss yet,” I thought as tears rushed down my cheeks. “Get a hold of yourself, Max, you aren’t a nerd for nothing think your way through this,” I told myself. The countdown to the black hole started TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE. Immediately I activated the force field FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. As the spacecraft entered the event horizon of the black hole, it started beeping like crazy. 
 </p>
<p> The black hole was trying to rip the spacecraft apart; as I was sweating confused by the beeping Lucas and Madilyn opened their hypersleep chambers and rushed to my side. I speedily updated them on what was going on, suddenly the singularity of the black hole (the end of the black hole) started increasing in width. Madilyn immediately pushes the thruster button “that’s our ticket out of here,” she said. The spacecraft sped off aided by the thrusters and a strange thing happened; an additional force was pushing the spacecraft out, and I made a guess and said was that a white hole. “Yeah it was,” Madilyn said happily as we got out of the white hole.  </p>
<p> “Hello I am right here,” Lucas said. “Yeah we can see you, oh and thanks for just standing there”, I said. “Wait for a second where are we,” Lucas said. I looked around and everywhere seemed different “Are we in another galaxy,” I asked. “I don’t think so,” Maddy replied as she put up a search for our location on the motherboard. “You are still in Kiklos Galaxios (Milky Way Galaxy), but in a different solar system,” the motherboard said. The motherboard continued “and you are approximately 52 light-years away from your destinatio…”. “What!” we interrupted.
